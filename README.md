# Scripts Programming Language

## Introduction

Scripts is a programming language created for the Leo Graphics Library.  It is used to control the behavior of assets, manage animation and character interactions.  It is a free format language that handle all the basic programming types: integer, float, string and boolean. 

The language is neither interpreted or compiled, but translated into a in memory tree representation and then executed.  Each command becomes a node in a tree and upon execution the tree is traversed.  

Scripts does not leave a foot print.  There are no object files that need linking or dynamic linking libraries.

## First Program

```
program;
    print "Hello, World!";
end;
```

## Variables

Variables within Script follow standard convention.  All variables must begin with an upper or lower letter.  The characters that follow can either by letter, numbers and the underscore character.

```

```
