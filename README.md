# Scripts Programming Language

## Introduction

Scripts is a programming language created for the Leo Graphics Library.  It is used to control the behavior of assets, manage animation and character interactions.  It is a free format language that handle all the basic programming types: integer, float, string and boolean. 

The language is neither interpreted or compiled, but translated into a in memory tree representation and then executed.  Each command becomes a node in a tree and upon execution the tree is traversed.

Scripts does not leave a foot print.  There are no object files that need linking or dynamic linking libraries.

## First Program

program;
    print "Hello, World!";
